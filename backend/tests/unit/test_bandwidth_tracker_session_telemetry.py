"""Unit tests for the unconditional ``session_telemetry`` write inside
``BandwidthTracker`` (bead ``enhancedchannelmanager-skqln.3`` step (d)).

Step (d) flipped the additive-write into the only-write: the legacy
``ChannelWatchStats`` write inside ``_collect_stats`` is gone, and the
``ECM_SESSION_TELEMETRY_WRITE_ENABLED`` feature flag has been retired.
The kill-switch's only purpose was the (a)→(d) transition; once legacy
writes are removed there is no off-state to gate.

Step (d) goals (mirrored by the test names below):

* ``session_telemetry`` rows are written unconditionally — no env-var
  guard, no fallback path. Every poll with active viewing connections
  produces one row per connection.
* The legacy ``ChannelWatchStats`` write inside ``_collect_stats`` is
  gone. No row is created in that table by a polling cycle.
* The helper still wraps its own work in try/except so an internal
  failure (constructor raise, schema mismatch, etc.) cannot propagate
  out of ``_collect_stats``. The legacy ``UniqueClientConnection`` /
  ``ChannelBandwidth`` writes that ran *before* the helper survive.

The tests drive ``_collect_stats`` end-to-end through a stubbed
``DispatcharrClient`` so the BandwidthTracker's own per-channel rollup
code paths are exercised. The session_telemetry schema
(``models.SessionTelemetry``) is created from ``Base.metadata`` in the
existing in-memory ``test_engine`` fixture from ``tests/conftest.py``.

Synthetic identities only — ``docs/security/threat_model_stats_v2.md``

# * Dispatcharr's ``/proxy/ts/status`` payload surfaces ``stream_id`` per
#   channel (the integer ID of the stream currently being served — the
#   ``StatsTab`` frontend already renders this from the same payload).
# * ``DispatcharrClient.get_streams_by_ids`` returns each stream's
#   ``m3u_account`` (either a bare int or ``{"id": N, ...}`` —
#   ``stream_prober.extract_m3u_account_id`` normalizes both shapes).
# * The resolver fetches the (stream_id → m3u_account_id) map ONCE per
#   poll (batched single API call, not N-per-channel) and caches it for
#   the duration of one ``_collect_stats`` invocation. The cache is
#   intentionally scoped to a single poll so a stream's provider can
#   change between polls without staleness.
#
# Failure modes are non-fatal: a row missing ``stream_id`` (Dispatcharr
# didn't surface it), a 404/exception on ``get_streams_by_ids``, or a
# stream whose ``m3u_account`` is None — all produce ``provider_id=NULL``
# plus a structured ``[STATS_V2] provider_resolution_failed`` log so

# Channel-streams fallback resolver tests (bd-5g7kx)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# kbgey's URL-fallback parses the trailing ``<id>.ts`` integer from the
# active stream URL and routes it through ``get_streams_by_ids``. But that
# integer is the upstream M3U provider's stream id, NOT Dispatcharr's row
# id — so ``get_streams_by_ids([upstream_id])`` returns nothing on most
# providers. (Coincidental wins happen when the upstream id happens to
# collide with a Dispatcharr id.)
#
# 5g7kx replaces the terminal ``stream_not_found_url_derived`` failure with
# a second-stage fallback: ``GET /channels/<channel_id>/streams`` returns
# the channel's stream list, and the resolver finds the stream whose
# ``url`` matches the active URL — that stream's ``m3u_account_id`` is the
# answer.
#
# Two cache layers:
#   * Per-poll: scoped to a single ``_resolve_provider_ids`` invocation, so
#     multiple unresolved channels with the same channel_uuid don't hit
#     Dispatcharr twice.
#   * Cross-poll LRU on ``BandwidthTracker``: channel stream lists are
#     relatively stable. Capped at 200 entries; TTL is poll-count-based
#     (30 polls = ~5 min at the 10s default poll interval).

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# skqln.3/.14 wrote ``buffer_event_count = 0`` on every session_telemetry row
# because the buffer-event source was not wired in. skqln.15 wires it: every
# poll fetches Dispatcharr's ``/api/core/system-events/?event_type=buffering``
# feed, de-duplicates the surfaced events by their integer ``event.id`` against
# a bounded LRU that persists across polls, and attributes each surviving
# event to the channel's session_telemetry rows for the current poll.
#
# Attribution model (the GH-59 chart sums ``buffer_event_count`` per
# ``(provider_id, time_bucket)``):
# * Each surviving buffer event applies to a single channel.
# * Per channel, the deduplicated event count is written to the FIRST
#   session_telemetry row emitted for that channel this poll (sorted by
#   client_ip for determinism). Other rows for the same channel poll write
#   ``buffer_event_count = 0``. ``SUM(buffer_event_count) GROUP BY provider,
#   time_bucket`` then returns the correct count without per-client double-
#   counting.
# * Channel with buffer events but NO active client rows this poll: count is
#   dropped (logged at WARNING). Rare — between client disconnect and channel
#   stop. Acceptable per acceptance criteria.
#
# Provider attribution at event time:
# * Each poll re-runs the resolver. The buffer-event count for poll N
#   attributes to whatever provider is active in poll N's resolver result.
# * Cross-poll failover: poll N+1 re-resolves to the NEW provider, so events
#   that arrived in poll N+1 attribute to the new provider. This is the
#   per-poll guarantee documented in the bead.
